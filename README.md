Election promises as Github documents and issues.


Verbatim version of the Barisan Nasional manifesto released by its chairman Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak on April 6, 2013


A PROMISE OF HOPE
=================

My fellow Malaysians,

The time has come for us to decide. The path of democracy has determined that the future of this nation lies in your hands as citizens. Power to the people is what free and fair elections are all about.

My late father Tun Abdul Razak Hussein once said, "Your duty to the nation is to fulfill the trust of the people to the best of your ability."

I stepped into the political realm 37 years ago and this is the first time that I will be leading the BN coalition into a general election. It will be an arduous task and a heavy responsibility.

Our founders have always expounded the values of commitment and sacrifice and these same values will guide me as I commit to fulfilling this task and honouring this responsibility.

The record of this Government in delivering on its promises speaks for itself. From economic, political and social transformation, to the upholding of democracy and human rights, we have moved surely and firmly towards a path of greater liberalization. Real changes have taken place, but the journey towards total transformation will take time.

The Vision 2020 policy to achieve developed status by the year 2020 was launched in 1991, and now 22 years later, I am happy to say that with the careful and conscientious policies of the BN Government, we are on track to achieving that.

As we head into this 13th General Election, I, as the leader of BN, humbly seek your mandate to carry on this task of lifting Malaysia to new heights. I seek to lead a Government that puts the interests and the welfare of the people first.

As Prime Minister of Malaysia, this mandate that I seek is about continuity and sustainability against disruption and stagnation, about moving forward versus regressing, about unity, stability, harmony and prosperity versus division, chaos, discord and crisis.

A mandate from you is a promise of hope, a mandate for us to achieve greatness together as one people, one nation, one vision. Allow me to continue serving you to the best of my ability.

I would like to assure you that the best is yet to come!

PEOPLE FIRST

1. EASING THE COST OF LIVING

Our on-going efforts to provide basic goods, services and necessities at lower prices are evident in our 1Malaysia products such as Kedai Rakyat 1Malaysia, Klinik 1Malaysia and Menu Rakyat 1Malaysia.

In Sabah and Sarawak, the Price Uniformity Scheme, transport subsidies and KR1M have all helped reduce prices of goods sold there. The National Agro-Food Policy has been introduced to ensure a secure and affordably priced supply of basic foods.

For the entire populace, schooling aid of RM100 per child and the RM250 1Malaysia Book Voucher scheme help alleviate expenditure, while the BR1M assistance for households earning below RM3,000 and singles earning below RM2,000, has provided much welcome relief.

In the next FIVE years, we commit to:

More efforts will be taken to ensure that urban centres develop in a systematic and well planned manner aimed at maintaining the quality of life for those living there.

3. PROVIDING AFFORDABLE & SECURE HOUSING

The BN Government's policies through the years have ensured the steady supply of all types of housing for the people. The last five years have seen an increase in affordable housing projects to ensure continued supply.

Apart from new homes, units that are in need of upgrade and repair are also being addressed with the setting up of a RM500 million fund while a further RM200 million has been set aside to rehabilitate the homes of fishermen throughout the country.

In the next FIVE years, we commit to:

"The Government is committed in ensuring that the rakyat has the opportunity to own a house. This is not only an economic imperative, but also a moral imperative for a responsible Government."

4. ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTH SERVICES

The Government subsidises 90% of all healthcare services to ensure access to quality treatment at the cheapest rates. Klinik 1Malaysia has expanded the network of outpatient treatment centres and the Government is also upgrading clinics in both rural and urban areas nationwide.

In order to address the country's evolving health services needs, more attention has been directed towards introducing affordable and wide-spread care for those suffering from lifestyle diseases and terminal illnesses.

Special attention must also be given to the care of an aging population and those with special needs as diagnostic methods and services continue to improve.

5. TOWARDS GREATER EFFICIENCY IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

No matter how fast we build, there will never be enough roads to cater for the number of vehicles. Good and reliable public transportation is therefore imperative.

The BN Government has established the LRT, Monorail and Commuter systems and expanded public bus services to cater to a growing need for public transport.

The expansion of LRT and Commuter lines will eventually see a combined total of 34km of new tracks and 13 new stations to serve the Kelana Jaya and Ampang areas.

6. WORLD CLASS INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT & RURAL TRANSFORMATION

The BN Government is continuously upgrading our infrastructure to ensure the continued and efficient growth of the economy and productivity. Infrastructure development also opens up new growth areas leading to the fairer distribution of wealth and development and more employment and business opportunities at all levels.

7. BUILDING A RESILIENT, DYNAMIC AND INNOVATIVE ECONOMY

Despite economic upheaval in many parts of the world, Malaysia managed to cushion the impact of the global economic slowdown and sustained its economic growth. This did not happen by chance but through careful and strategic planning initiated by the BN Government and supported by the people.

We are committed to further improving Malaysia's competitive position in global rankings.

A high income economy, driven by various transformation initiatives including emphasis on innovation and creativity, and based on fair & equitable distribution that is inclusive & sustainable, will see Malaysia reaching developed status come 2020.

8. BUILDING TOWARDS EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE

Malaysia provides free primary and secondary education for all. Pre-school education has been expanded with an additional 1,700 classes and enrolment has reached 72 percent. A National Education Blueprint (2013-2025) has been drawn up to put Malaysia on the path towards achieving quality education.

The BN Government's policy on higher education has continued to stress on producing high calibre and employable graduates. Access to attaining a higher education and skills & vocational training will increase, as will the financial means to achieving this.

9. ENHANCING SECURITY & PUBLIC SAFETY

The BN Government will do everything in its power to provide the people with a comfortable sense of security. Our efforts have paid off with marked reductions in the national crime index and overall street crime between 2009 and 2012. Despite this, we realise that much more needs to be done, including boosting community policing, to keep our families, homes & streets safe and secure.

The recent incursion by armed intruders into the state of Sabah has jolted all Malaysians into realizing that the peace and security we have enjoyed for so many years can never be taken for granted.

But we must desire to do more. From administrative posts to corporate hierarchy, efforts have been, and will continue to be taken to ensure that women have equal say in the decision making process.

12. WEAVING A NETWORK OF SOCIAL SAFETY NETS

From the physically & mentally handicapped to the aged & marginalised, it is the Government's responsibility to provide disadvantaged groups with their basic needs and ensure their comfort and ease of living. The BN Government has always subscribed to a welfare system that caters to all sections of the community regardless of creed or colour.

Our policies expand to both rural and urban pockets of the disadvantaged. We are aware that assistance and contributions from NGOs and other Malaysians are essential and necessary for these efforts to be more impactful.

Malaysia is recognised as a country that celebrates its diversity in unity, with the Government acting as enabler of religious practices. Our success as a Muslim nation is recognized by our status as the leading initiator and practitioner of Islamic banking and insurance systems.

While upholding Islam as the religion of the Federation, the freedom of non-Muslims to practice their faith is guaranteed, facilitated and enshrined in the Constitution. We will continue the work of the Inter-Religious Harmony Committee to promote not just tolerance, but acceptance of our multi-religious culture.

REFLECTION

"In our national discourse and in pursuing our national agenda, we must never leave anyone behind. We must reach out to the many who may have been disaffected and left confused by political games, deceit and showmanship...

"We must sow the seeds of goodwill and understanding in every corner of this land, so that we continue to harvest the fruits of progress and prosperity for all Malaysians...

"We recognise that the BN Government is not without fault. But while we have the courage to admit our weaknesses, there are those who are only willing to see the fault in others...

"In its 55 years of rule, the BN Government has recognised that racial unity forms the basis for national stability. But there are those who, for the sake of power, would rather sow seeds of conflict and hate...

"Thus, I urge Malaysians to judge the BN on its merits. Please join my colleagues and me in fulfilling our potential towards developing a country that we can be truly proud of...

"A country where the weak are protected, those in want assisted, the strong protect, the young are loved, the elderly valued, those in need are attended to, and those with potential given opportunities to bloom."

- Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak
